Automate Creation of Users using Bash script.

I created a Bash script called create_users.sh that automates the creation of users and groups, sets up home directories with appropriate permissions, generates random passwords, and logs all actions. 

Please see below the link to an article that walks you through the script, explaining its functionality and how to use it.
